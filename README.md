# Pocket Note

#### Wireframes: 
Trying it on my own notebook

#### User stories that describe how your app will be used:
Modern people are increasingly using cell phones rather than notebooks and pencils. People are playing games, read books, listen to songs and take notes on smartphones. On my app call "Pocket Note",  users can check the current weather in the app, create a to do list, and take note. And all that data can be saved and the user can check when the user wants to open it later.
A user must sign in to run the app since the notes are only for that specified user. 
When the user is not signed in, they only can check today's weather on the login page.
